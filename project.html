              This is a customized page for Ami, who runs a Korean restaurant at
              Hamilton Farmer's Market. To accommodate clients without a
              computer background, I built the site on Wix so that the client
              can easily maintain it. I completed the project by regularly
              communicating with the client to discuss progress and
              requirements.

              This project involved adding a feature to an existing website that
              automatically navigates visitors to branch-specific inventory
              pages based on their location. In addition to implementing this
              main feature, I also performed page maintenance and improved
              design functionality. Progress was regularly shared with the
              client through meetings, and all processes were fully documented.
